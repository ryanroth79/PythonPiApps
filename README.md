# PythonPiApps
Small Python applications for controlling stuff in the house from a Pi with a touchscreen.

# hueLightPHUE.py
Small application for controlling HUE lights. Has brightness and on off control. Brightness is set via slider and pressing the buttons with "B" appended to the light names.

To pair the calling computer and the bridge (I bet that's what is happening), press the button on the "bridge" prior to running the program.

Also, set the IP of the bridge in the code at: "b = Bridge('192.168.1.177')"
